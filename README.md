# FitbitProjects

My custom clock faces built using the [FitBit Developer Tools](https://dev.fitbit.com/).

These designs are built and customized for the [FitBit Versa smartwatch](https://www.fitbit.com/us/products/smartwatches/versa) and were created in VS Code with the [FitBit CLI](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/command-line-interface/).
